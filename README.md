# Identifying-Green-Trademarks-Semester-Project
Semester Project 1 Aalborg
This project develops and evaluates a machine learning model to classify trademarks as green or not green based on their textual descriptions. The approach uses a few-shot learning framework (SetFit) with sentence embeddings and compares its performance to a keyword-based EUIPO method
