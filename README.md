# Identifying-Green-Trademarks-Semester-Project

This project develops and evaluates a machine learning model to classify trademarks as green or not green based on their textual descriptions. The approach uses a few-shot learning framework (SetFit) with sentence embeddings and compares its performance to a keyword-based EUIPO method

How to Run:
Load and preprocess the trademark data

Train the initial SetFit model

Identify misclassified validation examples

Augment the training set and retrain from scratch

Evaluate final performance on the test set
